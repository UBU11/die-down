## ðŸ“‚ Files in This Project

The extension is built with four simple files:

1.  **`manifest.json`**: The core configuration file that tells Chrome how the extension works.
2.  **`newtab.html`**: The HTML file that provides the structure for the new tab page.
3.  **`style.css`**: The CSS file that creates the awesome comic book styling and layout.
4.  **`newtab.js`**: The JavaScript file that powers the countdown logic.

## ðŸš€ How to Install

To get this extension running in your own Chrome browser, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Download the Files:** Make sure you have all four files (`manifest.json`, `newtab.html`, `style.css`, `newtab.js`) saved in a single folder on your computer. Let's call the folder `Year End Countdown`.

2.  **Open Chrome Extensions:** Open your Google Chrome browser, type `chrome://extensions` into the address bar, and press Enter.

3.  **Enable Developer Mode:** In the top-right corner of the Extensions page, find the **"Developer mode"** switch and turn it on.

4.  **Load the Extension:**
    * Three new buttons will appear. Click on the **"Load unpacked"** button.
    * A file selection window will open. Navigate to and select your `Year End Countdown` folder (the entire folder, not the individual files).
    * Click "Select Folder".

5.  **Done!** The extension is now installed. Open a new tab (`Ctrl+T` or `Cmd+T`) to see your new comic book countdown in action!

## ðŸŽ¨ Customization

Feel free to change the colors, fonts, or the quote in the `style.css` and `newtab.html` files to make it your own. The font used is "Bangers" from Google Fonts.
